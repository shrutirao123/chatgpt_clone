  "Model / Variant  Multimodal? What Modalities \nSupported  Model tested  on 16gb  \nram \nBase Qwen / Qwen2 / \nQwen2. 5 (LL -only)  No Text only  These are standard \nLLMs; do not accept \nimages or audio input. Qwen -VL / Qwen2 -VL Yes Vision + Text (images + \ntext inputs)  Tested on ollama. Model is qwen 2. 5vl:7b \nand output is very \nslow. Qwen -Audio / Qwen2 -\nAudio  Yes Audio (speech or \nsound) + Text  Tested on ollama. Model is 7b and output \nis very slow. Qwen2. 5 -Omni  Yes  Text, Images, Audio, \nVideo inputs; outputs: \nText & Speech (audio) \nin streaming manner. Tested on huggingface  \nlocally , output  is \ncomparatively faster. Qwen3  Partial multimodal \n(depends on variant)  The VL versions / \nvariants would support \nvision + text; b ut many \nof the Qwen3 models \nare LL -only. The models available \nare mostly text based \nand new multimodal \nmodels are not \navailable yet. "
